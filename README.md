# DgIndiaBot
Digital India Bot

The DgIndiaBot is an approach to make common citizens of india aware of the various proceedings and different policies and procedures of the government.

Our bot on its startup displays a pre-defined menu from which the user can choose the option desired and the respective informatio will be given right there in just a few seconds.
The user can navigate through the menus without any confusion.

The intention was to include as many options, as many details as possible but due to time constraint and due to the reason that whole of our team was new at learning the botframework, we could not include many options, but the bot is designed in such a way that further addition and modification of options and details is simple.

Known bugs:
the text message displayed from the text files is not in proper orientation.

required softwares to run the bot:
Visual studio 2015
Microsoft bot framework channel emulator (3.0.0.59)
video recorded using Ice Cream me
